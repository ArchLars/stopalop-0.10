StopAlop, as a 1993-era shell-based package manager, is a relic of early Linux days when tools like floppies and manual file tracking were common. While it cleverly uses core UNIX utilities (tar, cpio, find, etc.) for basic packaging tasks, modernizing it would involve enhancing security, compatibility, maintainability, and integration with contemporary Linux ecosystems. How would you go about turning StopAlop into a modern package manager while retaining it's character? I want to use it on my custom LFS install.
